### Objective
To systematically link each identified feature and its security considerations, ensuring that all potential security issues are accounted for and tested.
### Activities
- **Matrix Creation:** Develop a matrix that traces each feature identified in the first two phases to specific security risks and planned tests. This matrix serves as a master document to ensure completeness in testing and to track progress against security objectives.
