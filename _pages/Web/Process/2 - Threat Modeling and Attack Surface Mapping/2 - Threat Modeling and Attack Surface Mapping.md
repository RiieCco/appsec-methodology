### Objective
To identify potential threats and comprehensively map the attack surface of the application, laying the groundwork for targeted and effective security testing.
### Activities
- **Component Mapping:** Document all components, data flows, and external interactions within the application. This helps in understanding how different parts of the application interact and where sensitive data is processed and stored.
- **Critical Assessment:** Analyze and prioritize the most business-critical parts of the application, assessing potential security risks in these areas. This step is crucial for focusing efforts on protecting parts of the system that would cause the most damage if compromised.
- **Logic Flaws Identification:** Examine the applicationâ€™s business logic for potential flaws. This involves thinking like an attacker to identify non-obvious vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
