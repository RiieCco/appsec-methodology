### Objective
Automated tools provide a rapid and scalable overview of potential security flaws, effectively identifying low-hanging fruit that might be overlooked in manual reviews, thereby enhancing the testing coverage.
### Activities
- **Static Code Analysis:** Employ tools like Semgrep and SCA to detect vulnerabilities in the codebase. This step automates the detection of common vulnerabilities and coding errors, speeding up the review process.
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Utilize tools like SonarQube to assess the complexity of functions, focusing on those with high cyclomatic and cognitive complexity as they are more prone to errors and security issues.
- **Findings Documentation:** Record all tool-generated findings for subsequent manual review and validation. This ensures that potential vulnerabilities are not only identified but also thoroughly examined and confirmed.
